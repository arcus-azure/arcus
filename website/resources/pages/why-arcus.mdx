    </Section.Left>
    <Section.Right>

        There are many reasons to use Arcus in your current and future projects. We’ve listed just a few here:

        - **Time-saving.** Arcus contains tremendous amounts of boilerplate code that helps you save loads of time during project development. It helps with infrastructure like secure secret management, application-wide telemetry tracking, tedious DevOps operations and even has fully development-ready project templates to get you started immediately.

        - **Centralized.** The entire Arcus framework is maintained and tested the same way, with the same set of dedicated experts. There exists a single point of truth where everything is maintained and made ready for your benefit.

        - **Best practices.** Every Arcus component has the industry-wide best practices baked right into the code. It is secure by-default, tracks telemetry by itself, automates hard-to-setup DevOps tasks, and many more.
