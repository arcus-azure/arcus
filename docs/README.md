# Deployment

## Netlify

This theme contains a `netlify.toml` and has been tested to work with Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/jekyll-serif-theme)

## Github Pages
This theme has been tested to work with Github Pages (and Github Project Pages)

If you are using this theme with Github Pages and you are using a Github Project Page then **your site will be hosted in a subfolder** you will need to update the `baseurl` in the `_config.yml` otherwise all the css, images and paths will be broken.

For example the site https://zerostaticthemes.github.io/jekyll-serif-theme would have `baseurl: "/jekyll-serif-theme"`
