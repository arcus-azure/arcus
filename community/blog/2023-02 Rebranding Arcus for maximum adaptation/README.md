# Rebranding Arcus for maximum adaptation
Arcus has received many updates regarding the branding of each component's feature documentation. Just recently, we took the final step in the rebranding of Arcus: a whole new general Arcus landing zone.

## Central place for everything Arcus
We already had a general Arcus site, but the problem was that it did not contain enough information to have almost any reason to live. To only reason we had it was to have a central location to send people to and from where they could be redirected to specific Arcus components. With the rebranding of Arcus' style we also took it upon us to rethink our central place for everything Arcus. Instead of it being a meager 'forwarding' site, it is now the place to be to find any general information on Arcus. We have listened to the pains of the people using Arcus and the people hesitant to use Arcus. With this knowledge, the website has received a whole new makeover that will maximize adaptation.

## The 'What', 'Why', and 'How' questions
It was the perfect time, during the creation of the new site with new contents, to reflect on what the general Arcus website should say and inform on. As Arcus is already available and used for several years, we know what the common issues are for not adapting Arcus. It was therefore our goal to make this new site a central place to answer all these common questions.

'What is Arcus?', 'Why should I use Arcus?', and 'How do I use Arcus?' are by far the winners in the struggle for adaption.

With dedicated tabs in the navigation, these questions are quickly answered by a short bullet-point list that feels like rapid fire. We hope that the list can be used in client projects to convince hesitant people of the quality and added production value of Arcus.

## Practical common use cases
Once people are convinced to use Arcus, one of the most asked questions that follow is if there are any use cases or examples to show the difference with Arcus. Normally, we send people to our high-value project templates because they already contain the latest updates and the latest code practices. Though, we have seen that for some people this is not enough. There was need for concrete examples.

The new site has three practical use cases that show:
* How secrets can be centralized with the Arcus secret store,
* How telemetry and contextual information can be simplified,
* How new projects can be fast set up with our project templates.

In a step-by-step walkthough, we show you what's the difference at code and high level of using Arcus in your project. Any uncertainty will be removed, any hesitance will be resolved. Arcus is ready.

## Conclusion
We have really listened to the issues and problems of using Arcus. We have bundled the answers on our new site and made sure that any arguments of not using Arcus are quickly resolved. This new website promotes the real value of Arcus that it deserves. It brings clarity in what was before a scattered project across feature documentation for each component. Now we have a central place to answer your questions, show you the advantages, and walk you through the process of adapting Arcus in your project.
