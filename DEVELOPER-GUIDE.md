# 1. Coding Guidelines

## 1.1. General
- Every public field/method should be documented with XML docs
- One file should only contain one class
- Variable names should have a clear name and abbreviations should be avoided
    - Exception would be LINQ statements, for loops, etc
- Private class fields should be prefixed with `_` such as `_serviceBusClient`
- Avoid using optional parameters for constructors and public methods
- If-statements that use a one-liner should be wrapped in `{ }`, an exception could be return statement or exception
- Avoid doing inline method calls to improve readability
    - Example to avoid - `throw new ApplicationException($"Event grid publishing failed. Content {await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync()}");`

## 1.2. Usage of `var`

It's ok to use `var` when the type of the variable is clear, but when calling methods you should explicitly mention the expected type.

Example:

```csharp
// OK
var value = "some value";
// OK
string value = "some value";
// NOK
var value = GetValue();
```

## 1.3. Working with `async` methods

- Every async method should be suffixed with `Async`

## 1.4. Testing
- A test should only test one specific scenario and a specific flow (ie. happy or failure)
- All tests for one class should be consolidated into one test class
    - Example `SecretKeyHandlerTests` contains all tests for the `SecretKeyHandler` class
- Every test method should have the following naming convention `{Method To Test}_{Scenario}_{Expected Outcome}`
    - Example: `Validate_WithValidSecretName_ShouldPass`
