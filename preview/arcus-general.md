# Arcus - Azure development in a breeze.

## What is Arcus?
A set of Codit-developed OSS libraries/tools that simplify building apps running on Microsoft Azure.
It is Coditâ€™s strategy to centralize company-wide best practices and use it across all our customers.

* Built By Experts, For Experts
  Sponsored by Codit! Maintained by a dedicated set of Codit experts that assures quality for our current and future clients.

* Modular Design
  All Arcus components are highly functional and composable. They can be used separately, but they are better together.

* Open-Source & Free to use
  The Arcus library is constantly updated by contributions from Codit employees and abroad!  
  As the Arcus library is free to use and open-source so we happily accept your contributions!  Please take a look at our [contribution guide](https://github.com/arcus-azure/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get up to speed if you want to contribute.

## Why should you use Arcus?
There are many reasons to use Arcus in your current and future projects.

  It helps with infrastructure like secure secret management, application-wide telemetry tracking, tedious DevOps operations and even has fully development-ready project templates to get you started immediately.

* Centralized
  The entire Arcus framework is maintained and tested the same way, with the same set of dedicated experts. There exists a single point of truth where everything is maintained and made ready for your benefit.
