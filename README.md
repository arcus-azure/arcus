 ## Starting a new components
 
 Every new Arcus component repo should be created via following flow:
 - Create a new repo based on our GitHub template which is located in [arcus-azure/arcus.template](https://github.com/arcus-azure/arcus.template).
   - We typically use the `arcus.{component-name}` naming convention
 - Run the [GitHub Repo Configurator
](https://github.com/arcus-azure/arcus/tree/master/tools/github-repo-configurator) to generate all default labels, issues and milestoned.
   - Add `arcus-automation` with Admin permissions to your new repo
   - Run the tool as `arcus-automation`
- Get started!

We have a variety of Azure DevOps YAML templates which you can re-use and are open for suggestion!
