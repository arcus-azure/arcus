# Out-of-the-box request tracking, simplified HTTP correlation & JWT authorization in Arcus Web API v1.0

With the release of version [Arcus WebApi v1.0](https://github.com/arcus-azure/arcus.webapi/releases/tag/v1.0.1), the logging functionality is greatly enhanced for better tracing in your current and future applications.

Come and take a look at what it has to offer!

## JWT authorization

This version has so a [renamed component](https://github.com/arcus-azure/arcus.webapi/issues/149) in the new `Arcus.WebApi.Security` package called: JWT authorization.
This component provides a mechanism that uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authorize requests access to the web application.

This authorization process consists of the following parts:
* Find the OpenID server endpoint to request the correct access token
* Determine the request header name you want to use where the access token should be available

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices()
{
    services.AddMvc(mvcOptions => mvcOptions.Filters.AddJwtTokenAuthorization());
}
```

For more information, see the [docs](https://webapi.arcus-azure.net/features/security/auth/jwt).

## Out-of-the-box Request tracking

Starting from this version, we allow you to track incoming requests by using a new middleware component building on top of `ILogger.LogRequest` (ðŸ‘‹ Arcus Observability).

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEvironment env)
{
    app.UseRequestTracking();

    ...
    app.UseMvc();
}
```

By default the request body is ignored and the headers are logged (except for some default security headers that can be altered).

Example:

`HTTP Request POST http://localhost:5000/weatherforecast completed with 200 in 00:00:00.0191554 at 03/23/2020 10:12:55 +00:00 - (Context: [Content-Type, application/json], [Body, {"today":"cloudy"}])`

As always, we allow you to fully configure it to how you want it to behave by using our fluent options API for `UseRequestTracking`:

<example>
For more information, see the [docs](https://webapi.arcus-azure.net/features/logging#logging-incoming-requests).

## Correlation merging

We have also made HTTP correlation with Serilog easier with the following extensions:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHttpCorrelation();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseHttpCorrelation();
    
    Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
        .Enrich.WithHttpCorrelationInfo()
        .WriteTo.Console()
        .CreateLogger();
}
```

For more information on correlation, see the [docs](https://webapi.arcus-azure.net/features/correlation).

## Breaking changes

* Starting from this version, the different packages `Arcus.WebApi.Security.Authentication` and `Arcus.WebApi.Security.Authorization` have been merged together in `Arcus.WebApi.Security`.
The reason for this was that the functionality in both packages is mostly all the time used togehter and doesn't have much meaning on its own.
* Starting from this version, we have decided to merge the correlation and logging functionality into a single package: `Arcus.WebApi.Logging`.
This for the very reason that both the functionality present in the correlation and logging packages is mostly all the time used together.
