title: Arcus Background Jobs
description: Arcus BackgroundJobs provides common repeated background tasks that strengthen an application. This goes from automatic secret invalidation of Azure Key Vault secrets to publish an event on Azure EventGrid upon a potential expired client secret in Azure. This collection of background tasks has grown from real-life application builders that wanted to re-use existing functionality in a safe and trusted manner.
