# The power of Arcus secret store

A question we get a lot, is what added-value the Arcus secret store provides. 'Why not use the Azure Key Vault SDK directly?'
In this post we'll take a look at the true power of the Arcus secret store so you understand why you should use the Arcus secret store in your next project.

The Arcus secret store is available as part of [Arcus security](https://github.com/arcus-azure/arcus.security) and contains thorough [documentation](https://security.arcus-azure.net/) if you want to explore other features available.

## What is Arcus Secret Store?

The Arcus secret store is a system that provides secrets located from various sources through a single access point. In a more complex application, secrets values can be located in Azure Key Vault(s), environment variables, HashiCorp Vault(s), development configuration files...

The Arcus secret store lets you access all of them with a single call instead of using specific SDKs to access them separately.

In many ways, the secret store looks similar to the [ASP.NET Core configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/) with some subtle but powerful differences.

Some terminology:
* A **Secret** is a notion of sensitive information that needs to be stored securely such as authentication keys, passwords, connection strings, client secrets...
* A **Secret provider** allows you to fetch secrets from a given secret source. While we support various sources such as Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, environment variables, and more, you can even build your own secret provider!
* A **Secret store** is a convenient way to query all configured secret providers with a single call, allowing you to configure all the various sources once and leave it up to us.

An example of a simple secret store configuration is shown here:

```csharp
using Arcus.Security.Core.Caching.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        return CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args)
    {
        return Host.CreateDefaultHostBuilder(args)
                   .ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, config) => 
                {
                    config.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
                          .AddJsonFile("appsettings.Development.json");
                })
                .ConfigureSecretStore((context, config, builder) =>
                {
#if DEBUG
                    builder.AddConfiguration(config);
#endif
                    var keyVaultName = config["KeyVault_Name"];
                    builder.AddEnvironmentVariables()
                           .AddAzureKeyVaultWithManagedServiceIdentity($"https://{keyVaultName}.vault.azure.net");
                });
    }
} 
```

> ðŸ’¡ When a secret is being retrieved, the secret providers are being called in the order they were registered. So in this case, the environment variables will be checked before the Azure Key Vault is contacted.

The secret store is also available for [Azure Functions](https://security.arcus-azure.net/features/secret-store/#using-secret-store-within-azure-functions) and [can be configured outside the `Program`](https://security.arcus-azure.net/features/secret-store/#configuring-secret-store-without-net-host-builder).

Let's look at the advantages of using our Arcus secret store.

## Designed for security

While [.NET's configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/) approach feels very similar, it does not make an explicit distinction between **configuration** and **secrets**.

Many vulnerabilities get introduced when secrets are seen as data and are included in logs, for example. Leakage of sensitive information is a real risk in this case. Or when expired secrets don't get transient handling upon retrieval.

**With Arcus secret store, you are making secrets a first-class citizen in .NET Core** to ensure they are handled accordingly.

We make sure that all the secret providers are registered in a central place and are being contacted via the secret store. This is much safer and easier to maintain since it is easy to get an overview of the various secret sources that the application depends on.

Lastly, there is a lot less work for end-users since they no longer have to write multiple service integrations themselves, scattered across the application, but instead rely on a variety of sources.

We also provide [security events](https://security.arcus-azure.net/features/secret-store/#include-security-auditing) to our secret store to make sure that malicious activity can be detected more easily. These events are written every time the secret store is queried.

With all the secret functionality in one place, you're not only making your application more secure but decreasing the maintenance effort.

## Caching

A feature that makes the secret store unique, is caching. This allows the secret providers to not hit service limitations based on your usage pattern and improve performance.

The secret store also allows you to define your own caching strategy for [custom secret providers](https://security.arcus-azure.net/features/secret-store/create-new-secret-provider) or extending existing ones.

The caching functionality acts as a 'wrapper' around existing secret providers and thus any secret provider you can think of can be 'wrapped' into a cached version.

```csharp
using Arcus.Security.Core.Caching;
using Arcus.Security.Core.Caching.Configuration;
using Arcus.Security.Core.Providers;

.ConfigureSecretStore((config, stores) =>
{
    // Configuration cache (optional: default is 5 min).
    var cacheConfiguration = new CacheConfiguration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10));

    // Built-in secret providers.
    var environmentVariables = new EnvironmentVariableSecretProvider();
    var cachedEnvironmentVariables = new CachedSecretProvider(environmentVariables, cacheConfiguration);

    // Custom secret providers.
    var windowsRegistry = new WindowsRegistrySecretProvider();
    var cachedWindowsRegistry = new CahcedSecretProvider(windowsRegistry, CacheConfiguration.Default);
});
```

We allow you to [asynchrounously invalidate the cache](https://background-jobs.arcus-azure.net/features/security/auto-invalidate-secrets) to automatically keep secrets aligned with the latest Azure Key Vault secrets. 

## Plug & play

Our secret store is very easy to set up. All that is required is defining what your secret store looks like through `ConfigureSecretStore`, after that you can immediately use our `ISecretProvider` interface abstraction throughout your application.

```csharp
using Arcus.Security.Core;

[ApiController]
public class OrderController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ISecretProvider _secretStore;

    public OrderController(ISecretProvider secretStore)
    {
        _secretStore = secretStore;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Orders()
    {
        string secret = await _secretStore.GetRawSecretAsync("MySecret");
    }
}
```

We are very flexible in the registration of the secret providers allowing all kinds of combinations and even multiple registrations of the same type, for example, you can use two Azure Key Vaults sources.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

.ConfigureSecretStore((config, stores) =>
{
    stores.AddAzureKeyVaultWithManagedServiceIdentity("https://shared-platform.vault.azure.net")
          .AddAzureKeyVaultWithManagedServiceIdentity("https://orders.vault.azure.net"); 
})
```

> Note that with our [named secret providers feature](https://security.arcus-azure.net/features/secret-store/named-secret-providers), you can retrieve a single secret provider instead of the combination. This can be useful in a scenario like this.

## Extensibility

We are open to extension!

As an example, we allow you to write your own secret providers to retrieve secrets where you need them or you can use [in-memory secret providers](https://github.com/arcus-azure/arcus.testing/blob/master/docs/features/inmemory-secret-provider.md) for testing purposes.

We are also working hard to make sure that *all* built-in secret providers are completely extensible so you can bring your own version of the existing functionality. If that's not enough, you can also [mutate secret names](https://security.arcus-azure.net/features/secret-store/create-new-secret-provider#adding-secret-name-mutation-before-looking-up-secret) on-the-fly when they come into any secret provider.

Even the registration process of the secret store is adaptable. We have demonstrated this [here](https://www.codit.eu/blog/role-based-authorization-low-level-customization-arcus-secret-store/) where we introduced an extra layer of authorization that determined which user role gets to access which secret provider.

## Conclusion

We talked a lot about only *some* of the major features of the Arcus secret store. There are many [other advanced features](https://security.arcus-azure.net/features/secret-store/) that make this an even more useful tool in your future projects.

We hope that with this post, you're as excited as we are with the secret store.
